# RESprojekat

This project is about 'Smart Home Energy System' which consists of five components: SHES (central component), Battery, Utility, Consumers, Solar panels.
SHES tracks the production of Solar panels, consumption of Consumers and calculates a difference in energy between those components, with the addition of Battery (which depends
on the time of the day production/consumption of electrical energy), and sends/receives electrical energy from 'Utility'. All data is written in the database by the central component (SHES).

# Built With

C# in Visual Studio 2017. Design was built with WPF (MVVM and classical behind code in some projects). For database were used: Entity Framework and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18.

# Created By
